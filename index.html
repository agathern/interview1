  <h2 class= "question1">Where are you from?</h2>
  <h3 class="answer1"> My parents are from the North of Mexico, but I was born in San Antonio, Texas. I mostly feel Mexican as my parents prioritized my siblings and me to remember our roots. Therefore I am very familiar with Mexican culture, and it is what I identify to the most.</h3>
<h2 class="question1">Where did you grow up?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1">I moved from Texas to Geneva, Switzerland, at the age of 4, and I have been here ever since.</h3>
<h2 class="question1">How was it growing up there?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1">I feel incredibly privileged to have grown up in Geneva. I do not think I had the same experiences as most people I have met in university so far. It is exceptionally safe, so I have always had a lot of freedom. I also went to an international school, so </h3>
<h4 class="emphasis">diversity has always felt familiar to me.</h4>
<h3 class="answer2">My friends ranged from Greek, English, Australian, Russian, Israeli, and many other cultures.</h3>
<h2 class="question1">How did you handle quarantine?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1">Here in Switzerland, we never went into full lockdown as the hospitals weren not necessarily overflowing. We also did not feel the need to fully lockdown since most people respect each other enough to follow the rules without being asked. So luckily, my experience wasn not too bad. We could still go out to fields with a maximum of five people. </h3>
<h2 class="question1">What are your hobbies?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1">My biggest hobby is probably photography. I particularly enjoy editing the images I take. I could spend hours editing the picture of coffee.</h3>
<h2 class="question1"> Is there anything in particular that attracted you to photography?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1"> I got my first camera for Christmas when I was twelve. I just always enjoyed taking pictures. At first, I would mostly take it on trips; however I quickly moved on from travel photography as I realised I did not necessarily enjoy taking landscape photos. What interested me more were portraits as</h3>
<h4 class="emphasis">I like capturing human expressions</h4>
<h2 class="question1"> how do you feel about your current situation? how are you handling online school?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1"> I was distraught when I found out I was going back to Geneva. Although I enjoy living here, it has never been a place that inspires me. The same thing happens every day, whereas in New York,</h3>
 <h4 class="emphasis">I would meet new people and see new things all the time, good or bad.</h4>
<h2 class="question1">has the pandemic and self-isolation helped you in any way?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1">I kept myself busy a lot more. I used to crave tranquility and rest, but the pandemic helped me rediscover the joy of working.</h3>
<h2 class="question1">is there anything you regret doing during quarantine?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1">I regret not reaching out to my family and my friends who live outside of Geneva more. I think I didnâ€™t realise the magnitude of the situation since  Geneva did not experience the same pandemic severity. Many of my family members got COVID 19, and some had near-death experiences. Although it was always cautious,</h3>
<h4 class="emphasis">I wish I had realised the seriousness and severity of the situation issue.</h4>
<h2 class="question1">where do you hope you will be in the future after the pandemic is over?</h2>
<h3 class="answer1">I am not sure anymore...</h3>
<h4 class="emphasis">Times are continually changing,</h4>
<h3 class="answer2">so I am not particularly eager to make plans for the far future. As of right now, I hope to return to New York and finish my studies and maybe find an unexpected internship.</h3>
